## Dictionaries

**Municipalities** :The files (a) *dictES.csv* and (b) *dictPR.csv*  yield some information about municipalities of (a) ES (B) PR states. These files have six columns:

1. *ID*: numeric key regarding calibration of confirmed cases time series
2. *ibgeID*: official code to identify the city
3. *name*: name of the city
4. *intermID*: official code of intermediate region to which the city belongs 
5. *imedID*: official code of immediate region to which the city belongs
6. *totPop2019*: population of the city estimated in 2019 

**Immediate and intermediate regions** The files (a) *dictImed.csv* and (b) *dictInterm.csv* yield some information about (a) Immediate and (b) Intermediate regions of PR and ES. These files have five columns:


1. *ID*: numeric key regarding calibration of confirmed cases time series
2. *imedID* or \verb|intermID|: official code to identify the region
3. *name*: name of the region
4. *state*: state to which the region belongs
5. *totPop2019*: population of the region estimated in 2019 


**States** The file *dictUF.csv* yield some information about PR and ES states. These files have five columns:

1. *ID*: numeric key regarding calibration of confirmed cases time series
2. *ibgeID*: official code to identify the state
3. *name*: name of the state
4. *uf*: abbreviation of the state's name
5. *totPop2019*: population of the state estimated in 2019 

## Time series

**Cases and deaths:** The files (a) *PR.csv*, (b) *ES.csv*, (c) *saopaulo.csv*  and (d) *manaus.csv* yield the time series of confirmed cases and deaths since April 1, 2020 for (a) All cities of PR state, (b) All cities of ES state, (c) SÃ£o Paulo city and (d) Manaus city. These files have seven columns: 

1. *date*: date
2. *ibgeID*: official code to identify the city
3. *newCases*: new confirmed cases on that day 
4. *newDeaths*: new confirmed deaths on that day
5. *city*: name of the city
6. *totalCases*: accumulated cases 
7. *totalDeaths*: accumulated deaths 

**Calibration:** Within files (a) *imed.zip* and (b) *state.zip* we have the time series of accumulated cases and fatality ratio, aggregated for different geographical levels. In this, we have two types of files: *casesXX.dat* (XX refers to the calibrating IDs mentioned before) are accumulated cases while *lethXX.dat* are the daily fatalities).

## Calibration Code

The file *calibra.f90* is a program written in Fortran that executes the calibration algorithm described on Methods section of the main paper $1000$ times with different epidemiological parameters. This program has four inputs: the time series of accumulated cases and fatality, the initial date for calibration and the population of the region (state, city, etc). Besides that, this program has two output files: *epiQuantities.dat* and *hiddenCompart.dat*. The first has seven columns:
1. Days from the initial time 
2. Calibrated confirmed cases
3. Reference cases
4. Effective reproductive number
5. Fraction of susceptible population
6. Underreporting coefficient
7. Sample

On *hiddenCompart.dat*, we have time series for some compartments in the model: from left to right *S*, *E*, *A*, *I*, *C<sub>A</sub>* + *C<sub>I</sub>*, *R* + *R<sub>I</sub>* + *R<sub>A</sub>* + *D* and sample number.

## Python scripts and figures

**Calculation of underreporting coefficient**: the file *underreporting.ipynb* is a I-python script that calculates the underreporting coefficient starting from a time series of confirmed cases and deaths. At the end, it exhibits a graphic showing the evolution of this coefficient.

**Template for figures** The majority of figures in this work were generated with *matplotlib* and *seaborn* packages of *Python 3.7*. File *format_covid19br.mplstyle* contains the template (font family and sizes) for generating those figures and graphics.
